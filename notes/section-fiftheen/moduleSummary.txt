Testing with csurf package
DO NOT use in production as package is deprecated

Authentication
- means that not every visitor of the page can view and interact w/ everything
- has to happen on the server-side & builds up on sessions
- you can protect routes by checking the (session-controlled) login status right
before you access a controller action

Security & UX
- Passwords should be stored in a hashed form
- CSRF attacks are a real issue and you should
include CSRF protection in ANY application you build!
- For better UX you can flash data/messages into the session
which you can display in your views
