Web works
Client => request => server => response => Client

Program Lifecycle & Event Loop
- Node runs non-blocking JS code and uses an event-drive code ("event Loop")
for running logic
- Node program exits as soon as there is no more work to do
- The createServer() event never finishes by default (manually need to exit)

Asycn code
- Js code is non-blocking
- use callbacks and events => order changes

Requests & Responses
- Parse request data in chunks (Streams & Buffers)
- Avoid "double responses" after res.end()

Core Modules
- Node ships with multiple core modules (fs, http, path, etc.)
- Code modules can be imported int0 any file
- Import via require('module')

The node module system
- Import via require('./path) for customer files or require('module') for
core and third-party Modules
- Export via module.exports or just exports (for multiple)
