Express Js
Alternatives: Adonis.js, Koa, Sails.js
Framework: Helper functions, tools & rules that help you build your application!

- Express Js is a node  js Framework - a package that adds
a bunch of utility funcs and tools and a clear set of rules
on how the app should be built (middleware)
- Its highly extensible and other packages can be plugged into it

middleware, next() and res()
- express relies heavily on middleware funcs - you can add them 
by calling use()
- middleware funcs handle a request and should call next() to forward 
the request to the next function in line or send a response

routing 
- you can filter requests by path and method
- if you filter by method, paths are matched exactly
- you can use the express.Router to split your routes across files elegantly

Serve files
- youre not limited to serving dummy text as a response
- you can sendFiles to you users - ex: HTML files
- if a request is directly made for a file, you can
enable static serving for such files via express.static()

SQL
- uses strict data schemas and relations
- can connect your node app via packages like mysql2
- writing quiereis is not directly related to node and something you have to learn in addition to node

Sequelize
- instead of writing SQL queries manually, you can use packages (ORMs) to focus on node code and work with
native JS objects
- allows you to define models and interact with the database through them
- can easily set up relation ("Associations") and interact with your related models through them
