DYNAMIC ROUTING
- You can pass dynamic path segments by adding a ":" to the Express router path
- The name you add is the name by which you extract using req.params
- Optional (query) parameters can also be passed (?param=value&b=2) and extracted (req.query.param or req.query.b)

MORE ON MODELS
- A Cart model was added - it holds static methods only
- You can interact between models (e.g. delete cart item if a product is deleted)
- Working with files for data storage is suboptimal for bigger amounts of data (better to use DB)
