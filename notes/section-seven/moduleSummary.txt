MVC

MODEL
- represents your data in your code
- work with your data (save, fetch)


VIEW
- What the users sees
- Decoupled from your application code
- Should not contain too much logic (PURE)


ROUTES -> CONTROLLERS
- connects your model and your views
- Makes sure the two can communicate in both direction
- contains the "in-between" logic
