SQL vs NoSQL

SQL (Structered Query Language)
- Data Schema
- All Data (in a Table) has to fit Schema
- Data relations -> Tables are Connected
  - One-to-One
  - One-to-Many
  - Many-to-Many
- Example: SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 28
- Horizontal scalling is difficult / impossible
- Vertical scaling is possible
- Limitations for lots of (thousands) read and write queries per seconds

NoSQL (non relational)
- Tables are called "Collections"
- Documents are object based and do not follow a strict schema (schema is not required)
- You CAN relate documents but you dont have to (doing this too much can slow down queries)
- Horizontal / Vertical scaling is possible
- Great performance for mass read & write requests

Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling

Horizontal
- Add more servers (and merge Data into one Database)

Vertical
- Improve Server Capacity / Hardware
