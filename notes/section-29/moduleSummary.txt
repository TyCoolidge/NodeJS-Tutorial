Preparing code for production

- Use env variables
- use production api keys
- reduce error output details -> dont send sensitive info to your users
- set secure response headers

Often handled by the Hosting Provider
- add asset compression -> reduce response size so client can download less
- configure logging
- use ssl / tls -> encrypt data in transit
