Advanced REST API Topics

From "Classic" to REST API
- Most server side code does not change,
only request & respone data changes
- More http methods are available
- REST API does not have any sessions

Authentication
- Since no sessions are used, auth works differently
- Each request needs to send data to prove request is authenticated
- JWT is a common way of storing auth and the client and validating
on the server
- JWTs are signed by server and can only be validated on the server (using a private key)
